So here is the problem that this script solves.

My wife is as veterinary sonographer and for every exam she has to make a report.

She took an average of 40 minutes for each report, and half of that time was to arrange the images in MS Word. 

The process was open, resize, align and arrange 16 images so that each line of images has two images, totaling eight lines of images on two sheets.

This script reads all images in a folder and join them images according to the defined parameters. The user can inform the number of images resized and the number of columns on each output file, the width and height of the resized images, the thickness and the color of the line separating the resized images, the prefix and the format of each output file. 

Once she started using the program, she takes only 20 minutes to make a report because she doesn't have to worry about the images anymore.
